This folder contains results of k_means algorithm
The results are generated from quant.txt, which contains data from [0,1]*[0,1] interval I.

The files with names prefixed by square:
square_3_steps_1.3957_err.png
square_5_steps_1.4173_err.png
square_6_steps_1.3163_err.png

has been generated by k_means with initial clusters choosen from 3 random points from interval I

The files with names prefixed by input:
input_3_steps_5.5344_err.png
input_6_steps_6.3653_err.png
input_7_steps_5.5344_err.png

has been generated by k_means with initial clusters choosen from 3 random data points from quant.txt 


The file names indicate how many steps took the algorithm to find the final Centroids
and how large was the final error. (The error is based on distance, see the source code)
